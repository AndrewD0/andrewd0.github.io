        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>As part of my role on the avionics team at <b>UBC AeroDesign</b>, I designed a power distribution PCB for
          stepping down power
          from the main battery to the rest of the components on the plane. I:
        <ul>
          <li>used <b>Altium</b> to design a 24V to 12V buck converter.</li>
          <li>assembled a PCB through a combination of hand and reflow soldering and conducted hardware troubleshooting
            tests.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          A buck converter is a type of circuit that is able to step down DC voltage through the use of a switch. This
          essentially works by rapidly switching on and off the switch.
          If, for a given period of time, the switch is off for an average of 50% of the period, the output will see a
          50% reduction in voltage. This percentage of time that the switch is off
          compared to the overall period is called the <b>duty cycle</b>. This method of controlling the output through
          rapidly turning on and off a switch is called PWM, or <b>pulse-width modulation</b>.
        </p>

        <p>Practically, an actual switch is not used. Most of the times, it's actually a transistor such as a MOSFET or
          BJT.</p>

        <p>However, in those times where the switch is open, the voltage at the output will fluctuate. To maintain
          smooth voltage and current delivery even while the switch is off, an LC filter is implemented at
          the output. The inductor resists changes in current and emits an EMF to keep current flowing constant while
          the capacitor will also emit current when it senses a change in voltage (from the switch turning off).
        </p>
        <img src="images/buck-diagram.png">
        <p>To give the current a path back to the negative end of the inductor when the switch is open, we add a
          Schottky diode in parallel with the load and capacitor.
        </p>

        <p>
          Buck converters are often used in power supplies due to their high efficiency, as the voltage is stepped down
          through a switch instead of dissipating voltage as heat (as seen in linear regulators). Moreover, buck
          converters can step voltage down from
          a wide range of input voltages to produce a wide range of output voltages.

        <h2>Design and Manufacturing</h2>

        <p>
          Numerous buck converter ICs are available to purchase online. To pick the best suited choice for our
          requirements, I utilized a weighted decision matrix to
          rank various IC choices and determine the best one. All ICs had to be able to step 30V input down to 5V and
          output 10 A (in line with our power requirements for the plane).
          However, there were other specifications such as cost, supply, footprint, that will put one choice above the
          other.
        </p>

        <p>
          Using a weighted decision matrix helped me quantitatively rank choices and provide a strong justification to
          my team as to why I chose a particular IC. I decided on the Texas Instruments LM5146.
        </p>

        <p>
          Following the datasheet, I calculated several values essential to designing the buck converter circuit. This
          would be
          the duty cycle, the inductor ripple current, peak switching/diode/inductor current, and the minimum inductance
          required for the inductor component.
        </p>

        <p>
          The final design is shown above. This includes an input current protection circuit, MOSFETs to handle the
          switching (controlled by the IC through a PWM signal), and castellated edges for soldering the buck converter
          onto a larger board. Via stitching was used to ensure minimum impedance for return currents. The use of polygon pours as power planes was also extensively used,
          as this provides better current-carrying capacity and heat dissipation.
        </p>

        <p>
          For our initial testing, the protection circuits were removed as well as the castellated edges to save on
          cost. The components were soldered using a reflow oven.

        <p>
          Testing was done through using an oscilloscope to measure the converter's input and output waveforms, and using measured values to calculate overall efficiency.
          The input voltage was varied while monitoring the output voltage ripple and load regulation.
