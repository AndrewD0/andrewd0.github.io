        <h2>Project Overview:</h2>
        <p>ENPH 353 is the second project-based course and competition designed for engineering physics students. Over
          the
          course of one semester, students in groups of 2 are tasked to control a robot using the <b>Robot Operating
            System</b> (ROS) software in a <b>Gazebo</b> environment and compete to accomplish several different tasks.
          For this year's competition, the robot had to be programmed to autonomously drive around a racetrack while
          reading and detecting "clues" placed around the environment. <br><br> Through this project, I learned about
          and
          applied several important topics including: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>using <b>Linux</b> to build and initialize a <b>Gazebo</b> environment with a controllable <b>ROS</b>
            robot. </li>
          <li>using ROS to create and program several <b>nodes for reading sensor data, motor control, image processing,
              and a topic subscriber service for communication.</b></li>
          <li>building a neural network from scratch and training it using gradient descent.</li>
          <li>building a robust <b>convolutional neural network</b> for letter recognition, requiring the generation of
            thousands of samples for training and validation.</li>
          <li>employing <b>Q-learning</b> to teach a robot how to drive.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> For interacting with the Gazebo environment, I used <b>OpenCV</b> to: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>design filtering and masking functions for robot driving.</li>
          <li>employ homography and perspective transforms to process clues.</li>
          <li>design a motion tracking algorithm using binary thresholding and frame deltas.</li>
        </ul>
