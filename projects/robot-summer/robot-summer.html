        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Over the summer of 2023, I designed and built an autonomous robot to compete in the annual <b>ENPH 253 Robot Summer</b> competition. 
          This project involved a wide range of skills, including electrical circuit design, embedded software development, and rapid mechanical design, protyping and fabrication.
          Moreover, as we were only given six weeks to build the entire robot from scratch, I also learned a lot about project management and team coordination.

        <h2>Competition Introduction</h2>

        <p>
          <b>ENPH 253: Introduction to Instrument Design</b> is a second-year engineering physics project course that exposes
          students to a wide range of hands-on engineering skills. In teams of four, students have to design, build, and test an autonomous robot to compete in a themed racing competition.
          In my year, the theme was Mario Kart! The robots had to autonomously race through a track with various obstacles, as well as collect coins on the way for extra points.
          <br><br>
          Students are only given six weeks to complete the entire project.
